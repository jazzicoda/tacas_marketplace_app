# The Problem
Artist of the Textile Art Community Art Space - TACAS - have a monthly market in order to display their wares, sell their wares and engage with the surrounding commmunity. Since COVID-19 Lockdowns started in March 2020, TACAS has struggled to engage with their community and earn an income from their labours.

This is a problem that has hit many creatives from across all areas of the arts. A template marketplace app could be something many other NFP organisations could use to increase their visibility and reach online, whilst trapped at home with these incessant lockdowns.

# Why Solve It?
Artists brighten our day
<br>
Artists deserve to make a living
<br>
Artists deserve to be seen
<br>
By giving this small independent organisation an app which they can use to market their beautiful creations, we will also be giving them a way to earn some money from their creations.
